# Anomalib oepnvino C++ reference

This repository provides an implementation of Anomalib's OpenVINO anomaly detection inference in C++. It includes two versions:

Minimal Inference (inference.cpp): Performs anomaly detection by predicting pixel-wise anomaly scores.

Visualization Inference (inference_with_visuals.cpp): Enhances the basic inference by overlaying segmentation results and heatmaps on the original image for visualization.

Features

Utilizes OpenVINO for efficient inference.

Supports pixel-wise anomaly detection.

Provides heatmap and segmentation overlay for enhanced analysis.
Note: This is a demo, you will need to use your own model and thresholds
